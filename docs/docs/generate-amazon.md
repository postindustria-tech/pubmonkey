# Generate an Amazon TAM Order

TAM Order generation is supported for both MoPub and GAM (Google Ad Manager). 

1. On the **Order** tab in PubMonkey click **CREATE** button.
2. As a **Header Bidding Service** choose "Amazon Publisher Services (TAM)".
3. Name your Order.
4. For Amazon we have a uniform and non-uniform price granularity implemented, most likely - you have received a price grid from your account manager - so use non-uniform price granularity.
5. Copy and paste your price grid in the format shown in the **KV Pairs** placeholder field.  F.e. highlighting and copying from a CSV opened in Excel or Google Spreadsheet - usually results in a correct format of KV Pairs.  
6. Amazon Creative restricts the ad format, thus you have to choose the **Creative format**.
7. Choose the ad units filtered according to the chosen ad format. 
8. For GAM you would also need to specify the Company - tap the **?** near that field to be taken to the Ad Manager page where you can create a Company.
