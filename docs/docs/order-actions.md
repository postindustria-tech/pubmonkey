## Import

PubMonkey accepts orders in a JSON file in the same interemdiate format it exports them.
**Note**: the format for MoPub and GAM is different, thus cross-ad server import is not supported, you can only import the orders which were exported or generated for a specific ad server. 

1. Click the Import button.
2. Choose the JSON file from your local disk.
3. Wait for the import to complete and check your imported orders.
