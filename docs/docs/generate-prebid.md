# Generate a Prebid Order

Prebid Order generation is supported for both MoPub and GAM (Google Ad Manager). 

1. On the **Order** tab in PubMonkey click **CREATE** button.
2. As a **Header Bidding Service** choose "Prebid.org".
3. Name your Order.
4. Choose the appropriate **Granularity** - default is **auto**.
5. There are also common defaults specified for line items naming and keywords.  You may wish to change them according to your use case.
6. Creative Snippet is also editable and reflects a standard Universal Creative described [here](http://prebid.org/overview/prebid-universal-creative.html).
7. Choose the needed ad units below the creative. 
8. You are all set.  For MoPub you can download a JSON representation to import an order later, or you can hit "Create in MoPub" right away.  For GAM - just hit "Create in GAM".
9. For GAM you would also need to specify the Company - tap the **?** near that field to be taken to the Ad Manager page where you can create a Company.
